🔌 Smart Switchboard Project
📌 Overview
The Smart Switchboard is a modern prototype aiming to replace traditional switchboards with intelligent, touch-sensitive, and remote-controllable units. Built using ESP32 and C++ (Arduino), it integrates environmental sensing and automation to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, and safety.

🧠 Key Features
🔐 Secure Storage Compartment for phones, keys, or wallets

🌡 Fan Speed Control based on computed Heat Index

⚡ Capacitive Touch Switches for modern interaction

👁️ Motion Sensing for automatic light activation

🔌 Inbuilt Type-C Charging Port

📱 Mobile Web Interface for remote control and monitoring

🔬 Technical Design
🔥 Heat Index Computation
A pseudo-ML logic computes Heat Index (HI) in real-time using:

T = Temperature (°C)

R = Relative Humidity (%)

Fan speed is adjusted based on a hardcoded decision logic mapping HI to speed levels (0–4).

⚙️ Functional Modes
🌟 Light Control
Mode	Behavior
OFF	Always off
AUTO	Turns on with motion; auto-off after timeout
FORCE ON	Always on, regardless of motion

🌀 Fan Control
Mode	Behavior
OFF	Always off
AUTO	Speed auto-adjusts via Heat Index
MANUAL	User selects level: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
