# Smart Switchboard Project

## Overview
The Smart Switchboard is a modern prototype aiming to replace traditional switchboards with intelligent, touch-sensitive, and remote-controllable units. Built using ESP32 and C++ (Arduino), it integrates environmental sensing and automation to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, and safety.

## Key Features
- Secure storage compartment for phones, keys, or wallets  
- Fan speed control based on computed Heat Index  
- Capacitive touch switches for modern interaction  
- Motion sensing for automatic light activation  
- Inbuilt Type-C charging port  
- Mobile web interface for remote control and monitoring  

## Technical Design

### Heat Index Computation
A pseudo-ML logic computes Heat Index (HI) in real-time using the formula:

\[
\begin{aligned}
HI = & -8.784695 + 1.61139411 \times T + 2.338549 \times R - 0.14611605 \times T \times R \\
& - 0.012308094 \times T^2 - 0.01642482 \times R^2 + 0.002211732 \times T^2 \times R \\
& + 0.00072546 \times T \times R^2 - 0.000003582 \times T^2 \times R^2
\end{aligned}
\]

Where:  
- \(T\) = Temperature (°C)  
- \(R\) = Relative Humidity (%)  

Fan speed is adjusted based on hardcoded decision logic mapping HI to speed levels (0–4).

### Functional Modes

| Light Control Mode | Behavior                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| OFF                | Always off                          |
| AUTO               | Turns on with motion; auto-off after timeout |
| FORCE ON           | Always on, regardless of motion     |

| Fan Control Mode | Behavior                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| OFF              | Always off                            |
| AUTO             | Speed auto-adjusts via Heat Index     |
| MANUAL           | User selects level: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% |
